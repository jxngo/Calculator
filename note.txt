    -Can reset stack now in reset();
    -Can now do complex expressions but only with single digits
    *First I need to find a way to capture multi-digits in one variable
    *then lastly convert inf

    -Can finally convert infix to postfix
    -postfix evaluation on display now
    *HOW TO CAPTURE MULTI DIGITS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    *Work on other interfaces.

    2:47pm
    -Can now display multiple digits 
    *Need to implement that into evaluation function
    *limit numbers from overflowing on display

    //*ISSUE* When calculating single digit, causes problem
    // When add/sub, then multiply/divide answer is wrong

    Issue is in convertPostfix function!
    Issue is, for eg. 9x9+9/2, converts to 99x92/+ instead of 99x9+2/
    - There is no issue. According to PEMDAS 9x9+9/2 is 85.5 not 45
    - The convertion is correct and evaluation.
    * how to do 9x9+9/2 -> 9x9 = 81, 81+9 = 90, 90/2 = 45?
